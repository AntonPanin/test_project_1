<p>We have Maths every day. It's the science of numbers. People say, Maths is hard. 
As for me, I don't agree. If you know the tables, it's as easy as ABC. 
At the lessons we learn to add, divide, multiply and subtract, because everybody
 uses numbers and Mathematics every day: when we go shopping, plan something,
 build houses, plant corn and vegetables and so on. As for me, I am good at Maths.</p>
